Implementation of graphs in Neo4j and MySQL for comparing their performance with the use case of ancestor trees. The implemented operations are finding all neighbours (nodes in the same level) of a node and finding the lowest common ansestor of nodes in a tree. The experiment description, source files for reproduction and results are in the Results directory.
